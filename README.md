# REST Booking API Testing with Postman & Newman
This project aims to automate the testing of a REST booking API using Postman and Newman. By automating the testing process, I ensure consistent and reliable validation of the API endpoints, reducing manual effort and enabling faster feedback on changes.
# Features
•	Comprehensive API testing suite covering various HTTP methods including GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
•	Requests with different configurations such as request bodies, pre-request scripts, and tests to ensure comprehensive API endpoint validation.
•	Easy-to-use Postman collections for executing tests locally or integrating into continuous integration pipelines.
•	Detailed test scripts to validate responses and ensure API functionality meets requirements.
•	Modularized structure for easy maintenance and scalability of test suites.
